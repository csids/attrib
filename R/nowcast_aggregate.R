#' @param data Dataset containing doe (Date of event), dor (Date of registation) and location_code. The columns must have these exact names.
#' @param aggregation_date Date of aggregation
#' @param n_week Number of weeks to calculate the percentage of the total registraations. Must be larger og equal to 2 amd smaller than the total number of weeks in the dataset.
