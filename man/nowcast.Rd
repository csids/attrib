\arguments{
\item{data_aggregated}{Aggregated dataset from the function npowcast_aggregate}

\item{offset}{Boolian variable. Should be true if one wants to have offset(pop) in the formula. Then pop_data must be in the}

\item{n_week_adjusting}{Number of weeks to correct}

\item{n_week_training}{Number of weeks to train on}

\item{nowcast_correction_fn}{Correction function. The deafault is nowcast_correction_fn_expanded. Must return the same as this function.}

\item{nowcast_correction_sim_fn}{Simmulatoin function. Must return a datatable with the following collumns  "n_death", "sim_value", "cut_doe", "ncor" and simmulations for equally many weeks as n_week_adjust.}
}
\value{
Dataset including the corrected values for n_death
